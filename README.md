# VAS Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Purpose

This code is designed for predicting the treatment outcome of KOA (Knee Osteoarthritis). It showcases the full process from data preprocessing, model training, to result generation.

## 💻 Environment

- Python 3.8+
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the required packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📥 Input Format
- Input data should be in XLSX format.
- A simulated example is provided in: /example_dataset.xlsx

## 📤 Output Format
- The output results are stored as CSV files in: outputs/results.csv
- Trained model files are also saved in the outputs directory.

## 🚨 Notes
- Due to privacy constraints, real clinical data is not included in this repository.
- Please contact the authors to request access to the actual dataset if needed.

## 🧪 Running the Code
- To execute the full pipeline:
